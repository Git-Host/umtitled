<h1><a href="unsubscribe">Underachieving unsubscribe confirmation pages</a></h1>

<p>Why do unsubscribe confirmation pages always look like this<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1276566/umtitled/post_images/unsubscribe.jpg" alt="Unsubscribe"></p>

<p>It's as if the idea of a mailing-list recipient unsubscribing from an email campaign is so outlandish that only bare minimum effort can be spared to build this function. Or maybe it was such an afterthought that the developer had no time to even wrap the confirmation message in the site's template<sup>2</sup>. Actually, I'll bet the boss's nephew is an aspiring <em>computer programmer</em> and hey, why not let the boy bang out a few lines of code?</p>

<p>I'll tell you why not: it's unprofessional and frankly, embarrassing (for you). Conceivably, this is the last chance your business will have to keep me as a customer (or reader, or whatever)... and you're going to blow it with a context devoid message?! Seeing something like this just strengthens my decision to unsubscribe. It solidifies my impression of your company as unprofessional and uncaring. And hey, now I'm really glad I left.</p>

<p>But what if you were to give some thought to the delivery of that message? Maybe remind me that your business is worth my time. At least wrap the page in your template... there's a good chance that I haven't been to your site in a long time. It might look fresh and new... and that might be enough to make me stick around.</p>

<p>Just do something better than this. Please. You're making us all<sup>3</sup> look bad.</p>

<hr>
<ol>
<li>Okay, they don't always look like this. But in my experience, most do.</li>
<li>Looks like the developer in the above image had some free cycles and went that extra mile with an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>By  "us all" I mean those of us who butter our bread by making stuff for the internet.</li>

<h1><a href="capital-i">We all live in a capital I, in the middle of the desert, in the center of the sky</a></h1>

<p>My son is just about the right age to start weening him onto Sesame Street. Thankfully, YouTube is bursting at the seams with full-length episodes... many of which are from, what I consider to be, the heyday of the series: the 1970s.</p>

<p>I extracted the following segment from <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_0514">episode 514</a><sup>1</sup>  (1972). It's entitled, "<a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/I_in_the_Sky">I in the Sky</a>". And it's bizarre.</p>

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t6-LsCTFtX4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In case you missed them, here are the lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all live in a capital I, in the middle of the desert, in the center of the sky. And all day long we polish on the I, to keep it clean and shiny so it brightens up the sky.</p>
  
  <p>Rubbing it here and scrubbing it there. Polishing the I so high in the air. </p>
  
  <p>As we work we sing a lively tune. It is great to be so happy on a busy afternoon. And when we're through with the day's only chore, we go into the I and we close the door. </p>
  
  <p>Capital I. Capital I. Capital I. Capital I. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Okay. Right. Umm. What?</em> My sentiments exactly. Curiosity got the better of me and I did a little digging<sup>2</sup>. Here's what I found:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is not the first appearance of the "I in the Sky" song. Apparently, it first aired in episode 427. <em>Who cares.</em> But more interestingly...</li>
<li>...the song reappears some <strong>35 years later</strong> (in 2007) when the imaginatively named character, Baby Bear, sings "the chorus of the song as he draws a capital I"<sup>3</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>35 years later. Wow. That's awesome. In fact, that's enough time for a child who grew up with Sesame Street in the 70s to <em>be</em> grown up and watch the song reappear in the 2007 episode with <em>their</em> child. Imagine the WTF-factor if that were to happen.</p>

<p>Go ahead, imagine it. I'll wait.</p>

<hr>
<ol>
<li>Episode 514 has no special significance. It was simply the first one I pulled down from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7DTksUfDaI">YouTube</a>. As it turns out, it's pretty awesome (as awesome as a Sesame Street episode can be... which, as it turns out, is pretty darn awesome). This particular episode features Stevie Wonder, by the way.</li>
<li>Don't be too impressed; there's a whole <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Sesame_Street_Episode_Guide">massive wiki</a> devoted to Sesame Street episodes.</li>
<li>If anyone knows where I might be able to watch that segment (or episode), I'd be eternally grateful... or at least, reasonably appreciative.</li>

<p>I agree with Hack a Day's sentiment of "<a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/06/16/finally-a-3d-printer-for-burritos/">Finally, a 3D printer for burritos</a>". From the <a href="http://burritob0t.com/?page_id=23">Burritob0t FAQ</a>:</p>

  <p>The BurritoB0t prints a 3D edible extrusion combining a blend of digital fabrication and gastronomy. It's digital gastronomy for the hungry masses.</p>

<h1><a href="wwdc-2012-missing-announcement">WWDC 2012's missing announcement</a></h1>

<p>WWDC 2012 has brought some impressive changes to Apple's laptop armada. Yet, there's still something missing...</p>

<p>Despite the fact that not one rumor site<sup>1</sup> was reporting this, I was half-expecting to see 3G brought to the MacBook line... in the same way it's in the iPad. Imagine, if you will, a 3G, month-to-month option in something like the MacBook Air. A marriage made in heaven, as far as I'm concerned. </p>

<p>Just this past week, I used an iPad with 3G for the first time. I was traveling to and from a conference<sup>2</sup> by train. It was a delightful experience to have capable internet access during the journey<sup>3</sup>... but my delight multiplied when I realized that I wasn't beholden to the shitty hotel wifi<sup>4</sup>. </p>

<p>My point is simply that using 3G on the iPad was a great experience. The only part that was suboptimal was the iPad itself. Don't get me wrong, I love me some iPad! Still, I'm a laptop holdout. Yep. I'm a card-carrying member of the ever decreasing populous of those who feel that they can be significantly more productive on a laptop<sup>5</sup>. Thus, bringing 3G to an ultra-portable Mac (like the 11 inch Air) would, in my mind, be a completely natural fit.</p>

<p>I can only assume that Apple has thought of this. And therefore, I can only assume that there's a technical hurdle preventing the inclusion of cellular data. Maybe it adds too much bulk? Could it be a licensing issue? Dunno. Either way, its absence is shocking<sup>6</sup>.</p>

<hr>
<ol>
<li>That I read, anyway.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium</a> conference, in case you're wondering. It was awesome, in case you're wondering.</li>
<li>On something bigger than my iPhone.</li>
<li>Hyatt Cambridge, in case you're wondering... although it could easily be any hotel. Let's face it, here in the US, hotel wifi is just shitty. The hotel itself was gorgeous though. Recommended... even despite the wifi.</li>
<li>Although, the gap is narrowing.</li>
<li>Yes, shocking.</li>
