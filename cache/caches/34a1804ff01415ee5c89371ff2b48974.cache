<h1><a href="ios-6-maps">Maps in iOS 6 are officially bad ass</a></h1>

<p>Seriously. Bad ass. The addition of turn-by-turn navigation alone is worth the upgrade price... which, umm, is nothing. The one missing feature<sup>1</sup> is the ability to rotate the map so the top of the device is pointing in the direction you're heading. </p>

<p>Maps on android can do this. I'm just sayin'...</p>

<p>Since Apple doesn't live stream the event anymore, I'll be watching the live blogs. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/11/apple-wwdc-2012-liveblog/">Engadget</a> and <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167098/live_update_wwdc_keynote.html">Macworld</a> have provided good coverage in years past.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping for some new, drool-worthy stuff...</p>

<h1><a href="duplicate-vs-save-as">Lion's "Duplicate" vs. the "Save as" of Yesteryear</a></h1>

<p>I've been using Mac OS X 10.7 Lion for almost a year now<sup>1</sup> and I am <em>still</em> fumbling with the dubious shift from the tried and true "Save as..." to the questionable "Duplicate". </p>

<p>Is it just me? Seriously. I'm okay with it if it is. It wouldn't be the first time that I disagreed with a fundamental change in the way things have been done for decades<sup>2</sup>. After all, it's human nature to fear change, right? Still, I just don't understand why Apple took away the straightforward, one-step process of clicking "Save as" and replaced it with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click "Duplicate"</li>
<li>Click "Save"</li>
<li>Find and close original document window</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that, my friends, is efficiency.</p>

<hr>
<ol>
<li>Mac OS X 10.7 Lion was released "via the Mac App Store on July 20, 2011," says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Wikipedia</a>. And yes, I was aboard that train on day 1.</li>
<li>Reverse scrolling. Need I say more? As it turns out, I thought I'd give it a try. And what do you know... I like it.</li>

<h1><a href="instapaper-free-starbucks">Instapaper, Free App Pick of the Week at Starbucks</a></h1>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1276566/umtitled/post_images/instapaper.jpg" alt="Instapaper Starbucks App of the Week"></p>

<p>This week, Starbucks is offering the excellent <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8%3FpartnerId%3D30">Instapaper</a> app (iPhone and iPad) as their <strong>free</strong> App Pick of the Week. </p>

<p><em>What is Instapaper?</em> Well it's a "<em>simple tool to save web pages for reading later</em>":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We discover web content throughout the day, and sometimes, we don't have time to read long articles right when we find them. Instapaper allows you to easily save them for later, when you do have time, so you don't just forget about them or skim through them. <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/faq">&rarr;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These days, Instapaper has some <a href="http://www.readability.com/">fierce</a> <a href="http://getpocket.com/">competition</a>. It was the first though, and still, arguably, the best. </p>

<p>Anyway, I picked up an extra promo code (<em>cuz I'm just that kinda guy</em>). Get it while it's hot:</p>

<h1><a href="nest-apple-store">Nest at the online Apple Store?</a></h1>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1276566/umtitled/post_images/nest.jpg" alt="Nest"></p>

<p>This is baffling to me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.nest.com/">Nest</a>, the learning thermostat created by [former Apple employee] Tony Fadell has been added to Apple's online store as of this morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, I get the connections; it's very Apple-ish in its UI, it's got apps, and it's... umm... okay, that's all I got. It's just a weird fit for the (online) Apple Store. Most, if not all, of the third party stuff Apple sells exists to enhance their products. So apps are sold to enhance the iPhone, laptop bags enhance laptops, etc... But that paradigm is backwards with the Nest. In this scenario, the iPhone is the third party enhancement to the Nest. Now that's not very Apple-ish.</p>

<p>I'm reluctant to say it, but this never would have happened under the  Jobs regime.</p>

<h1><a href="short-toolbar">CODA 2, squish the fatness</a></h1>

<p>One can, however, squish thing down to a more space efficient and, dare I say, attractive toolbar:</p>

<h1><a href="writeroom-for-cheap">WriteRoom: $2 well spent</a></h1>

<p><a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>, the minimalist, distraction-free writing environment is $2 on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writeroom/id417967324?mt=12">Mac App Store</a> today (2012-05-29).</p>

<p>In this increasingly crowded arena, I've tried 'em all: <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">IA Writer</a>, <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>, <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>, etc... While they've all got their strengths (along with plenty of weaknesses), WriteRoom shines in one important area: its writing window is very customizable... well no, not really. But it's more customizable than its competitors anyway. IA Writer, for example, offers no options for tweaking the editor. None. It is the epitome of the "<em>just fucking write, you dolt</em>" style of app. And I get that. Really. At the end if the day, it's the words on the page that matter, not finding the perfect shade of background gray that will be most conducive to writing a Pulitzer-quality blog post about distraction free writing environments. That said, nerds will be nerds and nerds need to tweak. WriteRoom, I think, provides just enough tweakablity without completely going down the nerd hole.</p>

<p>If WriteRoom has one flaw, it's the (glaringly painful) omission of Markdown awareness. Most other editors in this category offer some level of Markdown support. In Byword, typing <code># My Title</code> changes that line to bold, indicating that it's a heading. <code>1. First item</code> is recognized as the first entry in a numbered list. Hitting enter after that, automatically adds the obvious next line: <code>2.</code>...</p>

<p>Here's the thing though: Markdown was created to be editor agnostic. <em>Got a plain text editor? Okay, you're ready to rock Markdown.</em> So maybe Markdown awareness in a distraction free writing environment is... well, a distraction.</p>

<p>Anyway, for now, WriteRoom is my BFF. And for $2, it should be yours too. Get it while it's hot!</p>

<h1><a href="scandalous">Scandalous!</a></h1>

<p>I really, <strong>really</strong>, <strong>REALLY</strong> want to know what happened to cause <a href="http://daringfireball.net/colophon/">John Gruber</a> to break up with <a href="http://5by5.tv/people/dan-benjamin">Dan Benjamin</a>. They had such chemistry.</p>

<p>Some brief history: John did a podcast on Ben's network, <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a>, called <a href="http://5by5.tv/talkshow">The Talk Show</a>. It was about Mac and tech news mostly, but they left in plenty of time for general bullshitting. It was good. I was a super-fan. Then one day, The Talk Show was no more. </p>

<p>Well not exactly. John took his (<em>was it his to take?</em>) show, title and all, to the <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">Mule Radio Syndicate</a>. Only during his <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/2/">second episode</a> on Mule (with the fabulous <a href="http://lonelysandwich.com/">Lonely Sandwich</a>, A.K.A. <a href="http://adamlisagor.com/">Adam Lisagor</a> of <a href="http://sandwichvideo.com/">Sandwich Video</a>) did he address the elephant in the room... <em>errr</em>... podcast. And even then, details were sparse. Although, John did elude to some kind of business decision of Ben's that he just wasn't onboard with.</p>

<p>Dan attempted to be more official with the news by putting out a <a href="http://5by5.tv/specials/6">special episode</a> on 5by5 to address the situation. It was fluff though; no real details anywhere to be found. Still, I listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p>And that's all we know. Or at least that's all I know. I feel like a child of a messy divorce... no, not messy; confusing. It's like my parents, who I've always thought got on splendidly, one day announced that they're splitting up. Publicly, theirs was a model relationship. Behind closed doors, however, things were apparently very different.</p>

<p>(Clearly, I've a few issues of my own to work out here.)</p>
